# Instagram Reach Analysis
## Project Description
This project analyzes Instagram reach using machine learning techniques to identify patterns and drivers of reach. By understanding these factors, individuals, influencers, and businesses can optimize their content to enhance engagement.

## Objective
To analyze and predict Instagram reach using machine learning, aiming to uncover influential factors and provide actionable insights.

## Workflow
### Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Gather data on Instagram posts (content, hashtags, posting time, engagement metrics, follower count).
Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
### Visualization and Correlation Analysis:
Use histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to explore data.
Conduct correlation analysis to identify key relationships.
### Feature Selection:
Apply methods like correlation-based selection, recursive feature elimination, and Lasso regularization.
### PCA:
Reduce dimensionality while preserving variance to simplify the model.
### Model Building and Evaluation:
Train models (GradientBoostRegressor, Random Forest Regressor, Support Vector Regressor).
Optimize with hyperparameter tuning (grid search, random search).
Evaluate using metrics like MSE and R-squared.
### Model Comparison and Selection:
Compare models and select the best performer.

## Conclusion
This project provides insights into optimizing Instagram content strategy for better engagement. The analysis and models developed will help stakeholders make informed decisions to maximize their reach on the platform.
